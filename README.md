> **Business Question:** Which borrower segments are most likely to default — and what risk factors should the lending team act on immediately?

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Loan defaults cost financial institutions billions every year. This project simulates a retail lending portfolio and builds a Power BI risk dashboard that helps credit analysts and risk teams identify high-risk borrower segments using credit score, Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio, and loan characteristics — before approvals are made.

---

## 🎯 Key Business Questions Answered

- What is the overall default rate across the loan portfolio?
- Which credit score bands have the highest default risk?
- How does DTI ratio correlate with default probability?
- Which loan types and purposes carry the most risk?
- What is the total portfolio value at risk?

## 📈 Key DAX Measures

```dax
-- Default Rate %
Default Rate % = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER('Loans', 'Loans'[Status] = "Defaulted")),
    COUNTROWS('Loans'),
    0
) * 100

-- Total Portfolio Value at Risk
Portfolio at Risk = 
SUMX(
    FILTER('Loans', 'Loans'[Status] = "Defaulted"),
    'Loans'[Loan_Amount]
)

-- Average DTI by Risk Segment
Avg DTI = AVERAGE('Loans'[DTI_Ratio])

-- High Risk Borrower Count
High Risk Borrowers = 
COUNTROWS(
    FILTER('Loans', 
        'Loans'[Credit_Score] < 580 && 
        'Loans'[DTI_Ratio] > 0.43
    )
)
```

## 💡 Key Insights (What I Found)

- 🔴 Borrowers with **credit scores below 580** defaulted at 4.5x the rate of prime borrowers
- 📊 **DTI ratio above 43%** was the single strongest predictor of default across all loan types
- 🏠 **Personal loans** carried 2x higher default risk than secured home loans
- 💰 Borrowers in the **$25K–$50K loan range** represented 61% of total portfolio default value
- ✅ **Borrowers with 3+ years of credit history** had significantly lower default rates regardless of income
